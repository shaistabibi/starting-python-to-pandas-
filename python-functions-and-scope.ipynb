    "We can already see that the EMI for Option 1 is lower than the EMI for Option 2. However, it would be nice to round up the amount to full dollars, rather than showing digits after the decimal. To achieve this, we might want to write a function that can take a number and round it up to the next integer (e.g., 1.2 is rounded up to 2). That would be a great exercise to try out!\n",

    "However, since rounding numbers is a fairly common operation, Python provides a function for it (along with thousands of other functions) as part of the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/). Functions are organized into *modules* that need to be imported to use the functions they contain. \n",

The key benefit of using modules is _namespaces_: you must import the module to use its functions within a Python script or notebook. Namespaces provide encapsulation and avoid naming conflicts between your code and a module or across modules.\n",
